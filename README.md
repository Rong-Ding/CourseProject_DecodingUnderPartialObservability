This is a Python-based project, combining cutting-edge AI methods (the Autoencoder architecture) with simulated neurophysiological data, to investigate how effectively Autoencoders reconstruct latent states and system dynamics under varying degrees of (partial) observability.

The current project uses a Jupyter Notebook script, which first simulates oscillatory neurophysiological data and then builds and applies the Autoencoder architecture to uncover and reconstruct latent dynamics. To test the Autoencoder's ability to handle partial observability (e.g., due to missing variables, noise, etc.), I manipulated the total number of dimensions, as well as their categories, available to the Autoencoders. 
The project resulted in a report for the graduate course Complex Adaptive Systems in the AI master's programme at Radboud University. 

The repository consists of the Jupyter-Notebook script (**CAS2425_FinalProject_RongDing.ipynb**) and the resulting project report (**Final_Project_RD.pdf**).
